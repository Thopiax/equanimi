/**
 * Drift signal types for the equanimi platform.

 * A drift signal represents the moment a user moves away
 * from their declared intention toward a compulsive pattern.
 *
 * Desktop: drift = switching to a blocked app
 * Browser: drift = navigating to / staying on a shielded domain
 *
 * Both surfaces can emit drift signals. Cross-surface awareness
 * (future) would let desktop drift detection modulate browser
 * shield intensity and vice versa.
